# brick-kilns
This is a long due project that I discussed with Abid Omar founder of Pakistan Air Quality in the start of previous year. I am set out to complete it this time.

# Research articles  
This is excrept from the email I recieved from Abid Omar, so I am pasting it as it is:  
- http://bit.ly/PAQI_GovPunjab_brickkilns is the brick kiln census dashboard by the Urban Unit, but I found a lot of discrepancies in my random look through their data.
- http://bit.ly/PAQI_brickkilns is the effort by PAQI which serves two purposes, (1) mapping and (2) engaging the community to become aware about the huge number of kilns in their area
- http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2017/09/researchers-team-up-to-reduce-brick-kiln-pollution.html I emailed these guys, and I still - wait for their response, but this is perhaps out best bet in getting a way to automate the mapping process.
- http://www.terrapattern.com/  is also great, I've emailed them also, but they don't have the imagery currently except for a few cities.
- https://github.com/Microsoft/Earth-Lens another interested project that is applicable, but I haven't investigated it further.
- https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/ezzjcw/slavery-from-space this project utilized a crowd-sourcing model too
- https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search for NASA

# Strategy  
[ ] Using the open source government repository locate kilns and extract image.
[ ] Will have to look at the image.
[ ] Will make a classifier.
[ ] Get historical satellite image
[ ] Identify kilns.  

# Things to do  
As it is my first time to work on sattelite images I will be breaking it down and approching the problem step by step:  
[ ] Best source of latest sattelite images
[ ] Get satelltie images for given lat long
[ ] From the Punjab government data extract all brick kilns images and store it  
[ ] Manually clean the images and Build a classifier  
[ ] Algorithm to scan area and find brick kilns  

I will keep on adding more things to it. If you would like to contribute to this do send me an email at me@hamzaafridi.com
